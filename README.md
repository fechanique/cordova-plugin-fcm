#### Version 1.1.5 (10/10/2016)
- iOS10 ready
- Android and iOS tested.
- Available sdk functions: getToken, subscribeToTopic, unsubscribeFromTopic and JavaScript notification data reception.
- Added data payload parameter to check whether the user tapped on the notification or was received in foreground.
- **Free testing server available for free! https://cordova-plugin-fcm.appspot.com**

##Installation
```Bash
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-fcm

```

#### Firebase configuration
You will need 2 generated files in the Firebase configuration process (see docs: https://firebase.google.com/docs/).

#### Android compilation details
Put your generated file 'google-services.json' in the project root folder (`platforms/android`).

You don't have to edit Gradle project configuration, the plugin is doing that for you!

You will need to ensure that you have installed the following items through the Android SDK Manager:

- Android Support Library version 23 or greater (marked as obsolete, should not be required anymore)
- Android Support Repository version 20 or greater
- Google Play Services version 27 or greater
- Google Repository version 22 or greater

:warning: For Android >5.0 status bar icon, you must include transparent solid color icon with name 'fcm_push_icon.png' in the 'res' folder in the same way you add the other application icons.
If you do not set this resource, then the SDK will use the default icon for your app which may not meet the standards for Android 5.0.

#### iOS compilation details
Put your generated file 'GoogleService-Info.plist' in the project root folder (`platforms/ios`).


##Usage

:warning: It's highly recommended to use REST API to send push notifications because Firebase console does not have all the functionalities. **Pay attention to the payload example in order to use the plugin properly**.  
You can also test your notifications with the free testing server: https://cordova-plugin-fcm.appspot.com

####Get token

```javascript
//FCMPlugin.getToken( successCallback(token), errorCallback(err) );
//Keep in mind the function will return null if the token has not been established yet.
FCMPlugin.getToken(
  function(token){
    alert(token);
  },
  function(err){
    console.log('error retrieving token: ' + err);
  }
)
```

####Subscribe to topic

```javascript
//FCMPlugin.subscribeToTopic( topic, successCallback(msg), errorCallback(err) );
//All devices are subscribed automatically to 'all' and 'ios' or 'android' topic respectively.
//Must match the following regular expression: "[a-zA-Z0-9-_.~%]{1,900}".
FCMPlugin.subscribeToTopic('topicExample');
```

####Unsubscribe from topic

```javascript
//FCMPlugin.unsubscribeFromTopic( topic, successCallback(msg), errorCallback(err) );
FCMPlugin.unsubscribeFromTopic('topicExample');
```

####Receiving push notification data

```javascript
//FCMPlugin.onNotification( onNotificationCallback(data), successCallback(msg), errorCallback(err) )
//Here you define your application behaviour based on the notification data.
FCMPlugin.onNotification(
  function(data){
    if(data.wasTapped){
      //Notification was received on device tray and tapped by the user.
      alert( JSON.stringify(data) );
    }else{
      //Notification was received in foreground. Maybe the user needs to be notified.
      alert( JSON.stringify(data) );
    }
  },
  function(msg){
    console.log('onNotification callback successfully registered: ' + msg);
  },
  function(err){
    console.log('Error registering onNotification callback: ' + err);
  }
);
```

####Send notification. Payload example (REST API)
Full documentation: https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/http-server-ref  
Free testing server: https://cordova-plugin-fcm.appspot.com

:warning: Your key is available in the firebase console. To find it, log in your project, click on the Cog icon to go in the project settings, then Cloud Messaging and you will see the Server Key there.

```javascript
//POST: https://fcm.googleapis.com/fcm/send
//HEADER: Content-Type: application/json
//HEADER: Authorization: key=AIzaSy*******************
{
  "notification":{
    "title":"Notification title",  //Any value
    "body":"Notification body",  //Any value
    "sound":"default", //If you want notification sound
    "click_action":"FCM_PLUGIN_ACTIVITY",  //Must be present for Android
    "icon":"fcm_push_icon"  //White icon Android resource
  },
  "data":{
    "param1":"value1",  //Any data to be retrieved in the notification callback
    "param2":"value2"
  },
    "to":"/topics/topicExample", //Topic or single device
    "priority":"high", //If not set, notification won't be delivered on completely closed iOS app
    "restricted_package_name":"" //Optional. Set for application filtering
}
```
##How it works
Send a push notification to a single device or topic.
- 1.a Application is in foreground:
 - The user receives the notification data in the JavaScript callback without notification alert message (this is the normal behaviour of mobile push notifications).
- 1.b Application is in background:
 - The user receives the notification message in its device notification bar.
 - The user taps the notification and the application is opened.
 - The user receives the notification data in the JavaScript callback'.
